## Prompt 1
I want to build a game similar to Whack-A-Mole using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The game is called "FaceBomp," where players click on popping-up photos to earn points. 

Let's start with the HTML only, which should link to CSS and JS files:
* Display the game's title.
* Add a start button and a score display.
* Include the HTML to display a timer and an element for displaying
  a final message when the game ends.
* Create a game board with 6 "holes" containing an image (photo.png).

## Prompt 2
Style the game using a bright blue theme with background gradients
and complementary shades for the game controls and holes.

I want the holes to be circular and the photos to have a popping in/out effect.
Place the holes on a grid and center each image inside its hole.

## Prompt 3
Let's work on implementing the following with JavaScript:
* Images should gradually appear and then disappear into
  their holes one at a time at random intervals. When a player 
  clicks on an image, the player's score should increase by 1.
* The countdown timer is for 30 seconds. The game starts
  when the player clicks the "start" button and automatically
  stops when the timer reaches zero.
* When the game ends, the final score is displayed, 
  along with a fun, witty message based on the score.
* Players can restart the game by clicking the "start" button again.

Please add comments to the code to help me understand the logic.
